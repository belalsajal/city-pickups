          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            City Pickups is a platform that connects individuals and businesses ("Customers") who need items delivered with local couriers ("Couriers") who are willing to make those deliveries. We do not provide delivery services directly; we facilitate connections between Customers and Couriers.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            City Pickups is not responsible for the actions or inactions of Customers or Couriers. We do not guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of items delivered, nor the reliability, capability, or qualifications of Couriers beyond our basic verification processes.
